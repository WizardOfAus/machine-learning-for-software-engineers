## What Is Machine Learning

“Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” - Arthur Samuel, 1959

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.” — Tom Mitchell, Carnegie Mellon University
